# Lab 11: Parallel and Asynchronous Programming

## Starting code

The starting code is available as a `P3A-25Z-Task5` repository on GitHub in the WUT-MiNI organization.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "SSH" %}}
```bash
# Clone the repository:
git clone git@github.com:WUT-MiNI/P3A-25Z-Task5.git

# Change the origin url:
git remote set-url origin $(Your-personal-repository-address-for-this-task)
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "HTTPS" %}}
```bash
# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/WUT-MiNI/P3A-25Z-Task5.git

# Change the origin url:
git remote set-url origin $(Your-personal-repository-address-for-this-task)
```

## Fairplay

The repository contains a script that monitors your work. You need to run it. On Linux it will be `fairplay.desktop`; on Windows `fairplay.bat`. The script runs a screen recording program. The recording is saved on a network drive. The source code of the program is available for inspection in the [csharp-rec](https://github.com/P3-MINI/csharp-rec/tree/master) repository.
