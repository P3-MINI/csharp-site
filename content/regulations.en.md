title: "Regulations"
---

## 1. Recommendations or restrictions on student participation in a course resulting from the required sequence in which the courses should be followed in line with the study plan, and prerequisites

Knowledge of the following subjects is required: Programming 1 - Fundamentals, Programming 2 - Object Oriented, Computer Architecture, and UNIX Fundamentals.

## 2. Regulations on student mandatory attendance at courses for which attendance is obligatory, including the allowable limit of non-attendance and justification of non-attendance

Attendance at lectures is not mandatory but recommended due to the close connection between the lecture material and the laboratory.

Attendance at laboratory classes is mandatory. In case of absence, a student receives 0 points for activities conducted during the missed session.

An absence is considered excused upon presenting a medical leave to the course tutor. In special cases, the course coordinator may recognize absences caused by other reasons as excused.

A maximum of 3 absences from laboratory classes is allowed; more absences will result in failing the course.

## 3. Detailed methods of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement (e.g., the number of tests) and types of materials and devices approved for use by students during verification of learning outcomes achievement

The laboratory consists of:
- 8 workshops
- 1 project
- 7 laboratory tasks

The code quality is also evaluated. Inefficient solutions, non-compiling code, violations of object-oriented programming principles, and poor programming style may result in fewer points.

To earn points, solutions must be submitted to the server using the git version control system.

Solutions will be compared using an anti-plagiarism system. During the laboratory, at the teacher request, students are obliged to turn on dedicated software monitoring their work.

### Workshops

- Students can earn 1 point per workshop.
- Each workshop duration is 90 minutes during classes.
- Parts of the solutions may be created with the instructor during the class—these parts are not subject to anti-plagiarism checks; the rest must be created independently.
- An excused absence allows the student to complete the workshop at home within a week for full points.
- Workshops are done using the Arch Linux or Windows system on laboratory computers.

### Projects

- Students can earn 0 to 8 points per project.
- Project has a 2-week completion period from the time of assignment.
- Upon the instructor's request, students may be asked to present their submitted solutions during classes.
- The entire solution must be created independently.

### Laboratory Tasks

- Students can earn 0 to 12 points per laboratory task.
- Each laboratory task duration is 90 minutes during classes.
- The entire solution must be created independently.
- Laboratory tasks are divided into stages. Points for each stage are specified in the task description. Stages must be completed in the designated order.
- Each stage is checked and graded during classes.
- If a student has an excused absence, they may solve the laboratory task at home within a week. In this case, conversion points are awarded at the end of the semester.
  - Conversion points are calculated using the following method: {{< katex >}}S_1{{< /katex >}} is the average score of other students for that task, {{< katex >}}S_2{{< /katex >}} is the student's average score for other tasks, and {{< katex >}}S_3{{< /katex >}} is the result of the laboratory task solved at home.
  - The formula for points is: {{< katex >}} \frac{(S_1 + S_2)}{2} \cdot \frac{S_3}{12} {{< /katex >}}.
- Laboratory tasks are done using the Arch Linux or Windows system on laboratory computers.

## 4. Schedule of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement, in particular the dates of written and oral tests and deadlines for submission of reports on completed laboratory work and projects, including make-up dates, if the specifics of the course allow for it

Classes are held according to the schedule available on the website: https://csharp.mini.pw.edu.pl/pl/schedule/.

## 5. Possibility and rules for students’ participation in tests and examinations held on additional dates

The laboratory consists of:
- 8 workshops
- 1 project
- 7 laboratory tasks

The code quality is also evaluated. Inefficient solutions, non-compiling code, violations of object-oriented programming principles, and poor programming style may result in fewer points.

To earn points, solutions must be submitted to the server using the git version control system.

Solutions will be compared using an anti-plagiarism system. During the laboratory, at the teacher request, students are obliged to turn on dedicated software monitoring their work.

During the completion of project and laboratory tasks, students may use their own materials, system documentation, and the Internet, provided that the work evaluated is self-constructed. Particularly, using AI-generated solutions, such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, and similar tools, is prohibited.

Any publicly available code fragments used must not constitute a significant portion of the solution and must be clearly marked with references to their source. Materials sourced from the Internet must be understandable to the student, and the student should be able to explain the operation of the copied code.

### Workshops

- Students can earn 1 point per workshop.
- Each workshop duration is 90 minutes during classes.
- Parts of the solutions may be created with the instructor during the class—these parts are not subject to anti-plagiarism checks; the rest must be created independently.
- An excused absence allows the student to complete the workshop at home within a week for full points.
- Workshops are done using the Arch Linux or Windows system on laboratory computers.

- Laboratory tasks are done using the Arch Linux or Windows system on laboratory computers.

## 6. Rules for awarding course credit and the final course grade

To pass, a student must earn a total of more than 50 points.

Grading scale:

| Points      | Grade              |
|-------------|--------------------|
| \[0, 50\]   | 2.0 (fail)         |
| \(50, 60\]  | 3.0 (satisfactory) |
| \(60, 70\]  | 3.5 (fairly good)  |
| \(70, 80\]  | 4.0 (good)         |
| \(80, 90\]  | 4.5 (above good)   |
| \(90, 100\] | 5.0 (very good)    |

## 7. Dates and methods of providing information on the results of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement and grades awarded to students

Laboratory tasks and workshops are graded during the classes. Points are posted in the USOS system within 7 days after the classes.

Projects are graded by the course tutor within 7 days of receiving the solution. In this case, points are posted in the USOS system no later than 7 days after grading.

The final grade will be posted in the USOS system within 7 days of the last laboratory result publication.

## 8. The rules for improving the results of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement and grades awarded to students

It is not possible to improve laboratory results.

## 9. The rules for retaking particular types of classes included in the course due to unsatisfactory academic progress

A person who fails the course must retake the entire course and complete all assessments. Partial points from previous semesters cannot be transferred.

## 10. Other information depending on the specifics of the course
