# Project

As part of the course credit, students can implement any project in C#. The number of points depends on quality and effort invested.

Below are example projects:

## 1. Raytracer (Raytracing in One Weekend)

**Description:** Implement the first book "Raytracing in One Weekend" in C#.

**Important:** Minimize memory allocations during rendering (choice: class or struct).

**Welcome additions:** Parallelizing loops, saving to different formats, implementing further parts of the book.

**Points:** approx. 4

## 2. CityBike - LINQ Data Analysis

**Description:** Download data (e.g., from https://citibikenyc.com/system-data), load it, and perform at least 5 LINQ queries.

**Welcome additions:** Combine rental data with weather data.

**Points:** approx. 4 (depending on query complexity)

## 3. Backup Program

**Description:** Implement the requirements of the OPS project, but use threads, tasks, or asynchronous programming instead of processes.

**Points:** approx. 4

## 4. Photo Organization Program

**Description:** Monitor a folder (also recursively and in ZIP/TAR archives). Sort new photos by date and location. Read EXIF data, fetch location names from coordinates (e.g., Nominatim), and save in structure "year/month/day/" and "country/city".

**Points:** approx. 4

## 5. Network Game

**Description:** Create a network game of any genre.

**Points:** 4-12 (e.g., 4 pts for a turn-based console game, 8 pts for an agar.io clone in 2D)

**Welcome additions:** Use of a library for 2D/3D graphics rendering, physics engine.

## 6. Game in Godot or Unity

**Description:** Create a game in the chosen engine, with C# as the scripting language.

**Points:** Depending on complexity 4-8

## 7. Raytracer + P/Invoke

**Description:** Add a C API to a C++ Raytracer (you can use an existing implementation). In C#, create structure equivalents and import functions through P/Invoke. Define the scene on the C# side and call rendering by passing a progress callback (progress could be, e.g., render for X samples).

**Points:** approx. 8 (as part of a planned project)
